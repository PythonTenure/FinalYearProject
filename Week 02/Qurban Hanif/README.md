# Basemap

Basemap is a great tool for creating maps using python in a simple way. Itâ€™s a matplotlib extension, so it has got all its features to create data visualizations, and adds the geographical projections and some datasets to be able to plot coast lines, countries, and so on directly from the library.

# Basic Functions

Drawing a point in a map

[Plot method](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/api/basemap_api.html#mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap.plot)
## Documentation

[Documentation](https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The installation part is very well documented at the official docs.

https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

```bash
  pip install basemap
  cd basemap
```
    
## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Add more integrations

- The basemap is updated or added to the map. Only one basemap can be used at a time per map.

- Basemaps serve as a reference map on which you overlay data from layers and visualize geographic information. An individual basemap can be made of multiple feature, raster, or web layers. Basemaps are the foundation for your maps and provide context for your work.
