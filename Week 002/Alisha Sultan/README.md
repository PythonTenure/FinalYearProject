# Tkinter Python GUI Library

Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides a simple way to create windows, dialogs, buttons, menus, and other GUI elements for your Python applications.

## Features

- Easily create windows and dialogs.
- Create buttons, labels, entry fields, and other GUI widgets.
- Support for event handling and user interactions.
- Integration with Python's `tk` library for creating GUI applications.

## Getting Started

To use Tkinter in your Python project, you typically need to import it:

```python
import tkinter as tk
```

Then, you can create a main application window:

```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("My Tkinter App")
```

And start the main event loop:

```python
root.mainloop()
```

## Usage

You can use Tkinter to build a wide variety of GUI applications, including:

- Simple data entry forms
- Calculator applications
- Games
- Interactive utilities

For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

## Example

Here's a simple example of creating a Tkinter window with a button:

```python
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("My Tkinter App")

button = tk.Button(root, text="Click Me")
button.pack()

root.mainloop()
```
