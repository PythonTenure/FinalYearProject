## Project Overview

This project focuses on the automated delineation of supraglacial debris cover using deep learning and multisource remote sensing data. The goal is to develop a robust deep learning model that can accurately map debris-covered glaciers, enabling more efficient glacier monitoring and management.

## Major Purpose

The primary objective is to provide an automated method for mapping supraglacial debris using deep learning techniques combined with multisource remote sensing data. This approach aims to offer an effective alternative to traditional, labor-intensive manual methods, ensuring more accurate and efficient glacier monitoring and management.

## Key Points

### Problem Addressed
Traditional methods of mapping glaciers, especially those covered with debris, are labor-intensive and have limited accuracy due to the debris's similar reflectance properties to surrounding areas.

### Solution Proposed
The proposed solution is an automated deep learning model that utilizes a combination of remote sensing data types (visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, thermal infrared, microwave, elevation, and surface slope) to effectively differentiate between supraglacial debris and other materials.

### Model Training and Testing
- **Training Sites:** The deep learning model was trained on eight sites across the Himalayas.
- **Testing Sites:** The model was tested on three sites in the Karakoram region.
- **Accuracy:** The model achieved a high accuracy of 96.3%.

### Technological Framework
- **Deep Learning Model:** A fully connected feed-forward deep neural network optimized through various trials to determine the most effective architecture for the task.

## Output

The research output is a robust deep learning model capable of mapping debris-covered glaciers with high accuracy across large geographical areas. The study demonstrates the model's effectiveness through quantitative metrics and highlights its potential for broader application in glaciological studies.
